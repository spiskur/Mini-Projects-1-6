	<td width="500" height=""><p>I played the introduction of "Hall of Fame," by The Script, at the beginning. At 21 seconds, I split the audio and moved the song to conitnue at 57.5 seconds. My speaking part, with a piano instrumental, "Angel Eyes," by Jim Brickman, playing in the background, which begins at 20 seconds and continues to 58 seconds. I edited the audio to make the instrumental part softer so the speaking could be clearly heard. This part took 39.851 seconds. When finished, I continued with more of "Hall of Fame." 

I lowered the volume of the intro song beginning at about 16 seconds until a complete fade out at 21 seconds, where the background music and voice audio immediately began. About a second before the voice audio clip ended, the "Hall of Fame" track picked up with lyrics. A fade out was about 3 seconds long, with the entire audio ending after 1:42. 

I chose to use the song, "Hall of Fame," because I teach fifth grade and I think the lyrics are very motivational in this song. They follow our Growth Mindset in the classroom by reminding students that they can achieve anything they want.</p></td>
