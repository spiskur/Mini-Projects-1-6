<h2 style;"text-align:left;"> Explanation of editing: </h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"> I played the introduction of "Hall of Fame," by The Script, at the beginning. At 21 seconds, I split the audio and moved <br/>the song to conitnue at 57.5 seconds. My speaking part, with a piano instrumental, "Angel Eyes," by Jim Brickman, playing in the background, <br/>which begins at 20 seconds and continues to 58 seconds. I edited the audio to make the instrumental part softer so <br/>the speaking could be clearly heard. This part took 39.851 seconds. When finished, I continued with <br/>more of "Hall of Fame." 

I lowered the volume of the intro song beginning at about 16 seconds <br/>until a complete fade out at 21 seconds, where the background music and voice audio immediately began. <br/>About a second before the voice audio clip ended, the "Hall of Fame" track picked up with lyrics. A fade out was about 3 seconds <br/>long, with the entire audio ending after 1:42. 

I chose to use the song, "Hall of Fame," because I teach fifth grade <br/>and I think the lyrics are very motivational in this song. They follow our Growth Mindset <br/>in the classroom by reminding students that they can achieve anything they want.</p>
