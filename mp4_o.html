		<td>Mini Project 1</td>
		<td>This project only contained one error originally. The ordered list had a mistake in its naming. The error was not visible in the page, but did trip the validator. Also, from the debugging exercise, I found an error in the DOCTYPE code. It was a typo with a missing letter and slash. Those were also corrected. For the final product, I also adjusted the size coding for the photo so it would look more proportional.</td> 
	</tr>

	<tr align="center">
		<td>Mini Project 2</td>
		<td>This project contained the same error as Mini Project 1 originally. Since I had copied and pasted some of the coding for MP2 from MP1, it made sense and was easy to fix. I did adjust the coding for the size of the second set of pictures on the project so they were more proportional.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr align="center">
		<td>Mini Project 3</td>
		<td>This project contained 28 errors and 6 warnings. It contained the sae error as MP1 and MP2. I was able to cancel 9 errors by adding a closing quotation mark. 4 warnings were removed when I changed background to bgcolor.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr align="center">
		<td>Reflection</td>
		<td>	MP4 was a challenge. I enjoy puzzles, so I actually enjoyed working on this project quite a bit. I ended with three of my four pages passing validation (two were almost correct from the beginning). The MP3 page is showing errors with the audio file coding, and some of the heading codes. The page is opening correctly, however. This is where the puzzle requires me to look at the code from different angles to try to figure it out. I thought the debugging exercise was extremely helpful. I completed it while watching step-by-step on the instruction video so I was able to hear an explanation for each error. I learned a lot from this assignment and see that these concepts will be tools that I am able to use for the rest of my career in technology.</td>
