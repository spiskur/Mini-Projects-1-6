		<td width="530"><p>After Picture - First, I cropped the picture so the student and his desk with supplies are the main focus. This will be used to thank the United Way of Summit County for their generous donation. I also applied a filter that lightly clouded the image. I was able to apply a view circle around the student's face and collar so there would be a clear picture of him. I also applied a matted antique frame around the image. These processes were done using Photoshop, with the exception of the frame and vision circle. I used the program, "Pic Monkey," for those edits. This is a photo that I took of a student in my current classroom.</p></td>

		<td width="530"><p>After Picture - First, I cropped the picture so the student and volunteer would be at the center of the image. I used the clone stamp tool in Photoshop to remove the drapery cords, electrical wire, and small window from the wall. I also used the clone stamp tool to remove the person that was standing next to the student and the one that was behind the volunteer. I used the image size function to set the pixels to 600 wide and 799 height, with a resolution of 72 pixels per inch. I saved the image in large format, which took 156.4K. Then, I uploaded the image into Pic Monkey and used a poster line filter to create the unique style of the image. I also created the text in that program, using #008080.</p></td>
